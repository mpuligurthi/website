    My name is Mona, and I’m a future software developer, polyglot (speak ~8 languages), and soccer fan extraordinaire. I’ll be a junior double-majoring in Computer Science and Spanish at the University of Texas at Austin in Fall 2017. Having spent half my life in India before immigrating to the States, I had never imagined that our society shares a lot more in common than we think. The first day of seventh-grade Spanish class, and our family vacations across North America changed my outlook on culture forever, as I became fond of learning about various cultures through the power of language and travel. As I travel to more countries in the future, I hope to share my travels with everyone with the goal that they can experience the beauty of the world. Life is short, but the further we venture out of our comfort zones and the more we embrace each other’s differences, the closer we'll get to proceeding with life as it really is: an adventure.
